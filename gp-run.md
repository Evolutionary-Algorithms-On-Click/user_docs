# Genetic Programming (GP)

## Context

Genetic Programming (GP) is a type of evolutionary algorithm that evolves computer programs to solve problems. It is a domain-independent method that can automatically create a working program from a high-level problem statement. GP is particularly useful for problems where the solution is not obvious or where human expertise is not available.


## Configuring the Algorithm

1. Click on `Genetic Programming (GP)` in the home page to start working with **GPs**.

2. Select and configure all the necessary parameters one-by-one as required and click on `Exectute Algorithm` to get the result.


## Working with the Result

1. With the obtained result for your configuration, the following things can be done:

    >[!Info]
    >1. This run can be shared to other users via `Share runs` by entering their registered email ids, separated by commas if there are multiple.
