## Context

Genetic Programming (GP) is a type of evolutionary algorithm that evolves computer programs to solve problems. It is a domain-independent method that can automatically create a working program from a high-level problem statement. GP is particularly useful for problems where the solution is not obvious or where human expertise is not available.
