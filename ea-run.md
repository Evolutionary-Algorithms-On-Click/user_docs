## Evolutionary Algorithms

## Context

Evolutionary algorithm (EA) that does not involve Genetic Programming `GP` is called a traditional EA in EvOC.

## Building the Algorithm

1. Click on `Evolutionary Algorithms (EA)` in the home page to start working with **traditional EAs**.

>[!Note]
> Excluding **`de`** any among all other strategies can be selected for **traditional EA** approaches.

2. Select and configure all the necessary parameters one-by-one as required and click on `Exectute Algorithm` to get the result.

## Working with the Result

1. With the obtained result for your configuration, the following things can be done:

    >[!Info]
    >1. This run can be shared to other users via `Share runs` by entering their registered email ids, separated by commas if there are multiple.
