# Optimize ML Models with EA

> [!INFO]
> This page is a work in progress.

## Context

Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) can be used to optimize machine learning (ML) models. The optimization process involves tuning hyperparameters, selecting the best features, and optimizing the architecture of the ML model. EAs can be used to optimize the ML model for better performance, faster convergence, and reduced computational cost.
