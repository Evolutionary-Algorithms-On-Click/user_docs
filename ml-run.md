# Optimize ML Models with EA

## Context

Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) can be used to optimize machine learning (ML) models. The optimization process involves tuning hyperparameters, selecting the best features, and optimizing the architecture of the ML model. EAs can be used to optimize the ML model for better performance, faster convergence, and reduced computational cost.


## Building the Algorithm

1. Click on `EA for ML Model Tuning` in the home page to start **optimizing ML models** with EA.

2. Select and configure all the necessary parameters one-by-one as required and click on `Exectute Algorithm` to get the result.
    
    >[!NOTE]
    >1. A **google drive** URL of the dataset is preffered.
    >2. Enter the `target column` name exactly as it is named in the dataset.
    >3. If you want any other `metrics` to be optimized or use different `models` then make sure to import them as well.
    >4. The `custom evaluation function` can be edited as per user's interest, if not the default function will be used.

## Working with the Result

1. With the obtained result for your configuration, the following things can be done:

    >[!Info]
    >1. This run can be shared to other users via `Share runs` by entering their registered email ids, separated by commas if there are multiple.
