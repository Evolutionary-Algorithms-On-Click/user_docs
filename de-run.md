>[!Note]
> To work with **Differential Evolution**, **`de`** must be selected as the `Algorithm Strategy`, followed by its remaining configs.

2. Select and configure all the necessary parameters one-by-one as required and click on `Exectute Algorithm` to get the result.


## Working with the Result

1. With the obtained result for your configuration, the following things can be done:
